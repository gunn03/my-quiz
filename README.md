# **MY QUIZ**

This project is my first quiz its a four question multichioce style quiz with each question giving four possible answers. Developing this page was a lot of fun learning about Javascript and other languages. The page is a simple design with a Welcome home page, a navbar with a drop down instruction on How To Play and Start Quiz link that opens to the quiz page.

# **UDX**

This page is completely responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.

Its a very simple layout with a Home Page with a navigation bar very easy to use and navigate through.

I have used a Nav Bar toggle for tablet view 
and smaller, this is to decrease clutter and 
content overload for the user.
